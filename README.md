# yams

> Vuejs + vuetify to play yams/yatzhee with friends.

> Select Players from the select or type the name and press enter
> click on start when ready.

> At the end of the game, click "next game" to change the order for players (we prefer that the one who wins plays last)

> If you loose your game, just click on "recharger partie"


> The way scoring works is a bit different from the official way:
> If ou have more than 63 at top you have a 50 points bonus
> for -, trash, you add all 5 dices  
> for +, trash, you add all 5 dices but you need to have higher than - to have points
> the low straight is done by all 5 dices from 1 to 5
> the high straight is done by all 5 dices from 2 to 6
> for the bottom you add all 5 dices + bonus points next to the name

> just double-click in straights, Bonus Yams and Yams sec to add score.

> Good Game
